# [Binding.scala â€¢ TodoMVC](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/todo)

[Binding.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala) is a data-binding framework for [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), running on both JVM and [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).

Binding.scala can be used as a **[reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) web framework**.
It enables you use native XML literal syntax to create reactive DOM nodes,
which are able to automatically change whenever the data source changes.

Binding.scala's TodoMVC application has the tiniest code size among all the TodoMVC implementations,
only one source file, 150 lines of code!

Enjoy it!

## Getting Started

``` scala
@dom def render = {
  val value = Var("")
  <div>
    <input onchange={ event: Event => dom.currentTarget.value }/>
    Your input value is { value.each }
  </div>
}

@JSExport def main(): Unit = {
  dom.render(document.body, render)
}
```
